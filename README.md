# FinalYearProject
**3D AND 2D EDITOR TO CREATE RPG CREATURES AND ITEMS**

Third year final project that can create items and creatures within the Unity Eegine written in C#.

This project users a combination of scriptable objects to save the items/creatures data and custom editor windows. 

**ITEM CREATION PROCESS**

Creating an item is a multi stage process following the steps below should yield you a complete item. For the purposes of this example I will be creating a sword.


* Clicking on the window "Item + Creature Builder" at the top will give you a drop down called builder click it.
This will display the hub window. This window houses all of the systems that my project offers.

* The first window to use would be the folder window, when opened you will be able to remove/add folders from the Assets/Resources/BuiltItems directory.
You can create your own folder now for the items created later.
